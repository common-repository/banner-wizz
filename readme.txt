== Description ==

Banner wizz gives you the possibility to add contextual banner ads at the beginning or the end of every post of your blog , based on keywords occurrences. Because your blog will have a relevant banner ad on every post ,the plugin will help you maximize your conversions with affiliate programs, products, services or sites you promote on your blog.
How does it work?
For every banner you add through the admin interface you will need to set some keywords that describe the banner. The plugin counts the keywords in a post and for each post displays the banner with most keywords occurrences. If no keywords are entered, the plugin will act as a banner rotator and it will display a random banner in each post.
